# Predicting Mutual Fund Ratings
### Using ML techniques to successfully classify a fund into one of six classes

A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. These investors may be retail or institutional in nature. Mutual fund ratings is one of the most influential and prominent decision making factors that is used by investors in making a
decision with regards to selecting a mutual fund. Great Stone Rating is a star based ranking system. These ratings are based on the performance of a mutual
fund with adjustments for risks and costs as compared to other funds in the same category. The rating ranges from
0 to 5.

Goal: The goal of this project is to predict GreatStoneâ€™s rating of a mutual fund. In order to help investors decide on which mutual fund to pick for an investment, the task is to build a model that can predict the rating of a mutual fund. The various attributes that define a mutual fund can be used for building the model. This dataset comprises information of 25000 mutual funds in the United states. Various attributes related to the mutual fund have been described and these attributes will be used for making decisions on the rating of the mutual fund by GreatStone which is a top mutual fund rating agency.
